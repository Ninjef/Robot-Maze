# Description
When robot.html is opened in a browser a maze graphic is generated and a robot can be placed in the maze and made to find the exit automatically. You can also tell the robot to turn in any direction and move forward with the use of buttons. When the robot reaches the end of the maze the robot icon is replaced with a check mark.
