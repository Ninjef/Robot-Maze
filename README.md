# Description
When robot.html is opened in a browser, a maze graphic is generated, and the robot can be placed in the maze and made to find his way through the maze automatically. You can also tell the robot to turn in any direction, and move forward with the use of buttons. When you reach the end of the maze the robot icon is replaced with a check mark.


# What I wrote (JavaScript):
- The structure of the maze
- The robot's relationship to the maze
- Available interactions between the user and the robot
- Robot pathfinding
- What happens when the robot reaches the exit

What I did not write:
- The css that makes the program visible and interactive.
