# Object-Oriented-Javascript-Part-1
Code from a course I took on building a maze and robot that finds its way through the maze

I wrote everything in the js folder.

When robot.html is opened in a browser, a maze graphic is generated, and the robot can be placed in the maze and made to find his way through the maze automatically. You can also tell the robot to turn in any direction, and move forward with the use of buttons. When you reach the end of the maze the robot icon is replaced with a check mark.

My code determines the behavior of the program; the structure of the maze, the robot, the available interactions, the pathfinding, and what happens when the robot reaches the exit. I didn't write was the css that makes it visible and interactive.
